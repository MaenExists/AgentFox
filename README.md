# 🦊 AgentFox

**AgentFox** is a high-velocity browser built specifically for AI agents.

While traditional browsers are built for humans, and automation frameworks (Puppeteer/Playwright) are built for testers, **AgentFox is built for the agentic loop.** It is a daemon-backed, persistent browser that allows agents to search the web and interact with sites with near-zero latency.

## ⚡ Why AgentFox?

*   **Fast as fuck:** No cold starts. The daemon (`afoxd`) keeps the browser "hot" in the background. Commands execute instantly over a local Unix socket.
*   **Persistent Session:** Navigate, click, and browse across independent CLI calls. The browser maintains full session, cookie, and JS state.
*   **Agent-Native Snapshots:** `afox snap` provides a clean, semantic JSON tree of interactive elements. Your agent gets exactly what it needs to reason, not a 1MB HTML dump.
*   **Minimal Overhead:** Built with Rust and WebKitGTK. It's significantly lighter and faster than any Chromium-based solution.
*   **Search First:** A first-class `search` command that intelligently handles both direct URLs and search queries.

## 📖 The Agentic Loop

AgentFox is designed for the **Inspect -> Reason -> Act** cycle.

### 1. Start the Browser
```bash
afoxd &
```

### 2. Search & Navigate
```bash
afox search "latest news on autonomous agents"
```

### 3. Inspect the Surface
```bash
afox snap
```
Returns a clean, interactive element tree:
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/news",
  "title": "Agent News",
  "elements": [
    {"id": "e1", "role": "heading", "text": "Agents are the future"},
    {"id": "e2", "role": "link", "text": "Read More", "href": "/article/1"}
  ]
}
```

### 4. Act Instantly
```bash
afox click e2
afox fill e5 "agent@agentfox.dev"
```

## 🏗 Architecture

AgentFox uses a client-daemon architecture to eliminate the overhead of traditional browser control:

- `cli/`: The `afox` interface.
- `daemon/`: The `afoxd` browser engine (WebKitGTK).
- `protocol/`: High-speed JSON protocol for CLI-daemon communication.
